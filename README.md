## <Holaa! I’m Chio, 👋/>

<p> I’m a Web Designer & Front-End Developer based in Madrid. I love bringing ideas to life online through sleek, responsive, and user-focused websites. My goal is to create digital experiences that not only look beautiful but also feel intuitive and engaging for every user. </p>

<p> Coming from a background in Psychology and Art Therapy, along with experience in team and personnel management, I bring a unique perspective to design and development. This mix helps me understand both user behaviour and human-centre design, while also giving me strong organizational and collaborative skills. </p>
